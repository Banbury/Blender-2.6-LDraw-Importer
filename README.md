Blender 2.6 LDraw Importer
==========================
Hello everybody! Triangle717 here, reminding you that if you would like to learn more about this project, or donate code to it, you need to read this first.

History Lesson
--------------

This is a [Blender 2.6](http://www.blender.org) Importer script for the [LDraw System of Tools's Brick Library.](http://www.ldraw.org) 

> LDrawâ„¢ is an open standard for LEGO CAD programs that allow the user to create virtual LEGO models and scenes. You can use it to document models you have
> physically built, create building instructions just like LEGO, render 3D photo realistic images of your virtual models and even make animations. 
> The possibilities are endless. Unlike real LEGO bricks where you are limited by the number of parts and colors, in LDraw nothing is impossible.

There are many LDraw importer scripts available for Blender 2.3, each one with its own errors and quirks, but some that have even been lost over time due to 
dead links. Many people have wanted an updated version of these scripts for a while, but nobody seemed to want to write one.
 
However, David Pluntze did, and posted it [online](http://projects.blender.org/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=30327&group_id=153&atid=467) on February 23, 
2012. However, the script, written for Blender 2.5, was in poor shape and incomplete. By the time I found it in early October 2012, Blender 2.6 was already 
released, and the script was not even usable, due to changes in the Python API. I contacted my friend
[JrMasterModelBuilder](http://jrmastermodelbuilder.netai.net) who corrected the script for me, and allowed it to be used in Blender 2.6.

From then until January 2013, he and I tried to improve the script as much as possible. Many versions were released, and many bugs were fixed and identified. 
However, since I knew very little Python at the time, the process was very challenging.

After putting off uploading the script to the web for anyone to improve, I finally uploaded here, on GitHub.

Official Releases
-----------------

For the time being, I will decide when a official release of the script will happen, and it will be hosted on my personal [Sourceforge.net account] 
(http://sourceforge.net/projects/le717.u). In the future, the release cycle and download host will be changed, but it will stay as-is for now.
